## About Me

I am a Master's student in Advanced Computing at [Morgan State University](https://www.morgan.edu), currently working as a Research Associate at the Center for Equitable AI and Machine Learning Systems. My work primarily focuses on developing explainable and responsible AI methods for high-stakes domains like healthcare, disaster response, and industrial inspection.

I previously contributed to an NSF-funded research project on medical image captioning and concept detection, and also worked as a PREP Research Associate at NIST, where I built generative AI models for defect synthesis in additive manufacturing.

## Research Interests

- **Generative AI:** image synthesis, defect modeling, GANs
- **Multimodal Learning:** vision–language models, radiology captioning, VQA
- **Explainable AI:** interpretable models for healthcare and crisis domains
- **Computer Vision:** medical image analysis, classification, fingerprint detection
- **Deep Learning:** transformers, fine-tuning, model efficiency
